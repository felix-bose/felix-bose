## About me

Hi, I am Felix, a 28-year-old developer from Munich, Germany. I am really passionate about tech in general, but coding is my real love so to speak :blush:. The harder the problem the more satisfying it is to complete the challenge. I am always eager to learn and explore new concepts, languages and ideas.
Current side projects:

- [Lito](https://github.com/felix-schaipp/lito) (a react native household managing app)
- [iOS coinbase widget](https://github.com/felix-schaipp/coinbase-ios-widget) with a small [backend service](https://github.com/felix-schaipp/widget-service)
