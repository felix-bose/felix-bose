## About me
Hi, I am Felix, a 27-year-old developer from Munich, Germany. I am really passionate about tech in general, but coding is my real love so to speak :blush:. The harder the problem the more satisfying it is to complete the challenge. I am always eager to learn and explore new concepts or ideas. Currently trying to build an [iOS widget](https://github.com/felix-schaipp/coinbase-ios-widget) with a small [backend service](https://github.com/felix-schaipp/widget-service).
