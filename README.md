## About me
Hi, I am Felix, a 27-year-old developer from Munich, Germany. I am really passionate about tech in general, but coding is my real love so to speak :blush:. The harder the problem the more satisfying it is to complete the challenge. I am always eager to learn and explore new concepts or ideas. Currently trying some `competetive programming` and challanges at [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
