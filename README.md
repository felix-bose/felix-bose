Hi, I am Felix, fullstack engineer from Munich, Germany. Always curious and eager to try out new things. Why do a task 10mins manually if you can spend 10 hours automating it? 😂

Current side projects:
- Test factory generation for typescript (alpha)
- Client-side first demo application (the linear way)

##### programmic languages

> TypeScript ❤️ | Python (mainly, I tried a lot of things in the past)

I wanna start try out rust 👀
